            <h3>This was my favourite soup as a child. I remember it was one of the only things that could get me out of bed on a cold winter morning. Every spoonful of the salty and savoury soup warm my body.</h3>
            <ul>Ingredients
                <li>500ml water</li>
                <li>1 chicken or vegetable stock cube</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>75-100g of rice</li>
                <li>Salt, pepper and curry powder to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>Steps
                <li>First, place your water, stock cube and rice on boil</li>
                <li>Second, once boiling, lower the heat to medium-high and wait until the rice is tender and cooked</li>
                <li>Once the rice is cooked, lower the heat once more to low and crack in your egg. You should begin stirring and separating the egg so that small bites can form in the soup</li>
