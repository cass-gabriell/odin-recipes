    <h2>About this recipe</h2>
    <img src="./bagel.jpeg" alt="bacon cheese and egg bagel" height="310" width="310">
    <h3>One of my favourite breakfasts in the world, a delish, warm, crunchy and soft bagel, a ooey gooey egg and some beautiful melted cheese and vegan bacon. It's a crowd pleaser and definitely something to get you started on a Saturday morning</h3>
    <ul>Ingredients
        <li>A bagel of your liking, my favourite are everything bagels</li>
        <li>Your favourite cheese, my recommendation is a cheddar or edam</li>
        <li>Vegan bacon of your choice</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>A sauce of your choosing, my personal fav being Frank's Red Hot Buffalo</li>
    </ul>    
    <ol>Steps
        <li>Step one is to toast your bagels in the toasted, on bagel mode of course</li>
        <li>Next, in a frying pan, using a little butter or some oil, crack your egg in. You can keep it sunny side up, or be a little fancy and do an over easy</li>
        <li>In the same pan as your egg if you have room, fry up 2 vegan bacon strips for 2 minutes</li>
        <li>Next, it's time to assemble your bagel. I like to layer the bacon on the bottom, cheese in the middle and egg on top for ultimate ooey-ness</li>
        <li>Lastly, add your seasonings and sauce of your choice and make sure to eat it while it's hot</li>
    </ol>
