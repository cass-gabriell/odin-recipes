            <img src="./images/soupiesoup.webp">
            <h3>This is my favourite homemade soup from my childhood. On a cold winter's morning, it was the thing that got me out of bed. The salty and savouriness of the soup, paired with the cooked eggs bits and the fresh spring onion, are something that bring back memories with every spoonful</h3>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cube Vegetable or Chicken stock</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>500ml water</li>
                <li>Long grain white rice (or whatever you have in your pantry)</li>
                <li>Salt, pepper and curry powder to taste</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Steps</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>First, put your water in the pot on boil with your stock cube and preferred amount of rice. There should be much more water to rice as we are combining it into the soup and not just making rice</li>
                <li>Second, when the water boils, bring down to a medium-high heat and let simmer until the rice is fully cooked</li>
                <li>Once the rice is fully cooked, turn the heat down to low and crack your egg in. You should begin stirring the egg and breaking it apart to form small bites in the soup</li>
                <li>Lastly, add your salt, pepper, and my personal favourite, curry powder, to taste, and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
